Goals: Provide a powerful and elegant photo-mosaic application in python that
	1. Takes one source image and a set of tile images and creates a photo-mosaic from them of the first image
	2. Has the following controls:
		A. Tile image directories - specify one ore more replace image directories
		B. Output size and format
		C. A set of replacement strategies - TDB by best recommendation
		D. Controls for tile size used - i.e. 16x16 etc.
		E. How tile images are converted to tiles for comparison (I.e. if the all end up square for tile replacement, then how do images become square - stretch, fill, etc etc.
		F. Other controls that you think would make this great
	3. Performs global optimizations
		A. Don't repeat / repeat max times
		B. Max percent of image (i.e. one tile can be no more that 1% of the tiles used)
		C. Ensures a globally optimal placement of images:
			i. Lazy strategy - perhaps with a control over how much laziness
			ii. Random strategy - perhaps with a control over ho random
			iii. Full optimize - perhaps with a max depth or max something parameter so this won't run forever
	4. Performs caching and pooling and multithreading if necessary
	5. Has both a command line and application interface and both are fully capable	
	6. Title: Photo Mosaic - Free [FaigleLabs]
	7. Other goals that would make this great - I was thinking hexagonal tiles also - lmk

Please make a plan
